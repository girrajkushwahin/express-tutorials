=> EJS : 
- is a templating engine.
- is simple, lightweight and fast
- most downloaded on npm
- founded in feb, 2011
- created by TJ Holowaychuk

- npm install ejs
- app.set('view engine','ejs')
- app.set('views',path.resolve('./views'))
- in views dir, index.ejs
- in route handler, res.render('index',{})

=> Here above, in res.render('index',{}), we can pass data to the index.ejs file inside this object. This data is received by index.ejs file for showing or performing other operations on this data.

<% js-code %>
<%= ejs-variable %>
<%- include("layout/header") %>

When developing the layout of a webpage, we follow component based approach to reuse the code. Above syntax is used for including other ejs code(component) in working ejs file.
